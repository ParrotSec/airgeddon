## Collaborating Translators

1. Update the date under shebang.
2. Translate the strings located in `language_strings.sh` and the existing phrases _language_strings_handling_messages function_ in `airgeddon.sh`.
3. Ask by mail [v1s1t0r.1s.h3r3@gmail.com] if you have any doubt. You'll be informed about how to proceed.
4. You can be added as a collaborator on the project.
5. Knowledge about `git` is not mandatory but is really appreciated to push directly into the project repository.
6. If you want to create a pull request with a new language to be added, at least the 80% of the phrases must be translated and the rest must be done with at least _an automatic-translation_ system and marked with PoT (Pending of Translation) mark.

## Collaborating Developers

1. Tweak *"debug_mode"* variable to "1" for faster development skipping intro and initial checks or to "2" for verbosity and the skips mentioned before.
2. Respect the **4 width tab indentation**, code style and the **UTF-8 encoding**.
3. Use **LF** (Unix) line break type (not CR or CRLF).
4. Use [Shellcheck] to search for errors and warnings on code. (Thanks [xtonousou] for the tip :wink:). To avoid false positive warnings you must launch shellcheck using `-x` argument to follow source files and from the directory where `airgeddon.sh` is. For example: `cd /path/to/airgeddon && shellcheck -x airgeddon.sh`
5. Increase the version numbers in `airgeddon.sh`, in [Readme] and in [Changelog] to the new version that the script represents. The versioning scheme we use is *X.YZ*. Where:
  - *X* is a major release with a new menu (e.g. WPS menu)
  - *Y* is a minor release with a new feature for an existing menu or a new submenu for an existing feature
  - *Z* is a minor release with new bug fixes, small modifications or code improvements
6. Update the date on `.sh` and `.db` files under shebang, if appropriate.
7. Split your commits into parts. Each part represents a unique change on files.
8. Direct push to [Master] is not allowed.
9. Pull Requests to [Master] are not allowed. Should be done over [Dev] or any other branch. They require revision and approvement.
10. All the development and coding must be in English.

*Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!*

We also have a private Telegram group for *trusted collaborators* for more agile discussion about developments, improvements, etc. 
To be added on it you must prove first you are a *trusted collaborator* with your contributions.

## WPS PIN Database Collaborators

1. Send MAC of the BSSID and the default PIN to [v1s1t0r.1s.h3r3@gmail.com]. If you are going to push directly into the repository, keep reading the next points.
2. Add PINs ordered by the key in the associative array located in the `known_pins.db` file. (Keys are the first 6 BSSID digits).
3. Update the `pindb_checksum.txt` file with the calculated checksum of the database file using `md5sum` tool.
4. Update the date under shebang.

*PINs should be from devices that generate generic ones.*

## Beta Testers

1. Download the master version or the beta testing version from the development branch called [Dev]. Temporary branches may be existing for specific features that can be tested too.
2. Report any issues or bugs by mail [v1s1t0r.1s.h3r3@gmail.com] or submit issue requests [Here].
